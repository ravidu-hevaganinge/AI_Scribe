HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Martha Collins is a 50-year-old female with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, depression, and hypertension who presents for her annual exam. It has been a year since I last saw the patient.

The patient has been traveling a lot recently since things have gotten a bit better. She reports that she got her COVID-19 vaccine so she feels safer about traveling. She has been doing a lot of hiking.

She reports that she is staying active. She has continued watching her diet and she is doing well with that. The patient states that she is avoiding salty foods that she likes to eat. She has continued utilizing her medications. The patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in her legs.

Regarding her depression, she reports that she has been going to therapy every week for the past year. This has been really helpful for her. She denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.

The patient reports that she is still forgetting to take her blood pressure medication. She has noticed that when work gets more stressful, her blood pressure goes up. She reports that work has been going okay, but it has been a lot of long hours lately.

She endorses some nasal congestion from some of the fall allergies. She denies any other symptoms of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain."

The patient has been traveling a lot recently since things have gotten a bit better. She reports that she got her COVID-19 vaccine so she feels safer about traveling. She has been doing a lot of hiking.

She reports that she is staying active. She has continued watching her diet and she is doing well with that. The patient states that she is avoiding salty foods that she likes to eat. She has continued utilizing her medications. The patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in her legs.

Regarding her depression, she reports that she has been going to therapy every week for the past year. This has been really helpful for her. She denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.

The patient reports that she is still forgetting to take her blood pressure medication. She has noticed that when work gets more stressful, her blood pressure goes up. She reports that work has been going okay, but it has been a lot of long hours lately.

The patient has been traveling a lot recently since things have gotten a bit better. She reports that she got her COVID-19 vaccine so she feels safer about traveling. She has been doing a lot of hiking.

She reports that she is staying active. She has continued watching her diet and she is doing well with that. The patient states that she is avoiding salty foods that she likes to eat. She has continued utilizing her medications. The patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in her legs.

Regarding her depression, she reports that she has been going to therapy every week for the past year. This has been really helpful for her. She denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.

The patient reports that she is still forgetting to take her blood pressure medication. She has noticed that when work gets more stressful, her blood pressure goes up. She reports that work has been going okay, but it has been a lot of long hours lately.

The patient has been traveling a lot recently since things have gotten a bit better. She reports that she got her COVID-19 vaccine so she feels safer about traveling. She has been doing a lot of hiking.

She reports that she is staying active. She has continued watching her diet and she is doing well with that. The patient states that she is avoiding salty foods that she likes to eat. She has continued utilizing her medications. The patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in her legs.

Regarding her depression, she reports that she has been going to therapy every week for the past year. This has been really helpful for her. She denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.

The patient reports that she is still forgetting to take her blood pressure medication. She has noticed that when work gets more stressful, her blood pressure goes up. She reports that work has been going okay, but it has been a lot of long hours lately.

[doctor] okay okay just a couple questions for you you did say that you have the pain at night in that and you have to you get that numbness into the hand is it in all the fingers
[patient] yeah it seems to happen to all my fingers but i notice it more in my thumb and pointer finger
[doctor] okay okay and anything into that little into your fifth finger your little finger any numbness there at times no
[patient] sometimes yeah it seems like it's numb too
[doctor] okay what about your right hand any problems with that hand

[doctor] okay okay good and just a couple you know do you how do you have many or do you drink often do you have you know many any alcohol consumption
[patient] i drink usually a a beer or two on fridays and saturdays on the weekends
[doctor] okay and do you have any evidence of any anybody ever said that you had some rheumatoid arthritis in your hand or wrist anything like that
[patient] no nobody say anything like that so i mean
[doctor] okay okay good so let me go ahead and do a physical exam here real quick and you know i'm gon na quickly just listen to your heart and lungs okay that's good i'd like you to squeeze i'm gon na hold your hands here and i'd like you to squeeze both hands
[patient] okay
[doctor] you seem a little bit weaker on that left hand is that what you've noticed
[patient] yeah i i i experienced some weakness in my left hand
[doctor] okay do you you find that you're dropping things when you're picking it up is it to that level or
[patient] yeah i drop things mostly because i have a hard time feeling it
[doctor] okay okay good and so you you do have a a grip strength is less on the left and i just wan na touch your fingers here on the on the right side you can feel me touching all the fingers on the right
[patient] yeah i can i can say you touch me but it feels a little more weird on the thumb side than my pointer finger side
[doctor] okay okay and i wan na turn your wrist over here and turn your hand over and i'm gon na go ahead and tap on the right wrist on the back here does that do anything when i do that

[doctor] okay that would be good so that's i i just want you to kinda eliminate that the active repetitive motions that you're doing all the time just for a couple weeks i'm also gon na give you a wrist splint to wear and that should help and i'd like you to take ibuprofen six hundred milligrams every six hours and then i wan na see you back here in the office in two weeks and in that two week period i think we're gon na see if there's need for any other intervention if i need to do more diagnostic testing or if there is a possibly looking at a surgical intervention to release that pressure that's on the nerves in that hand does that sound like a a good plan for you

[patient] yeah it sounds like a good first start
[doctor] okay okay so i i just just off off the record here what kind of what do what do you specialize in landscaping is your company do

[patient] okay
[doctor] you know if you're looking for like some
[patient] backyard elasis rehab remodel that's i mean i suppose we could do we have n't done things like that in a while because we're busy enough with just the up key but it's something to explore
[doctor] okay yeah i may have to keep that in mind because i do wan na do some of that so let's listen i'm gon na get my my nurse in here to discharge you do you have any other questions for me before we end this

[doctor] okay okay just a couple questions for you you did say that you have the pain at night in that and you have to you get that numbness into the hand is it in all the fingers
[patient] yeah it seems to happen to all my fingers but i notice it more in my thumb and pointer finger
[doctor] okay okay and anything into that little into your fifth finger your little finger any numbness there at times no
[patient] sometimes yeah it seems like it's numb too
[doctor] okay what about your right hand any problems with that hand

[patient] okay
[doctor] you seem a little bit weaker on that left hand is that what you've noticed
[patient] yeah i i i experienced some weakness in my left hand
[doctor] okay do you you find that you're dropping things when you're picking it up is it to that level or
[patient] yeah i drop things mostly because i have a hard time feeling it
[doctor] okay okay good and so you you do have a a grip strength is less on the left and i just wan na touch your fingers here on the on the right side you can feel me touching all the fingers on the right
[patient] yeah i can i can say you touch me but it feels a little more weird on the thumb side than my pointer finger side
[doctor] okay okay and i wan na turn your wrist over here and turn your hand over and i'm gon na go ahead and tap on the right wrist on the back here does that do anything when i do that

[doctor] okay that would be good so that's i i just want you to kinda eliminate that the active repetitive motions that you're doing all the time just for a couple weeks i'm also gon na give you a wrist splint to wear and that should help and i'd like you to take ibuprofen six hundred milligrams every six hours and then i wan na see you back here in the office in two weeks and in that two week period i think we're gon na see if there's need for any other intervention if i need to do more diagnostic testing or if there is a possibly looking at a surgical intervention to release that pressure that's on the nerves in that hand does that sound like a a good plan for you
[patient] yeah it sounds like a good first start
[doctor] okay okay so i i just just off off the record here what kind of what do what do you specialize in landscaping is your company do
[patient] mostly like yard work and maintenance flower beds not really designing just up keep

Left wrist and hand pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

George Lewis is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of left wrist and hand pain. He reports an onset of a few months ago but denies any specific injury. However, the patient notes he often engages in repetitive motions while performing his work duties. His symptoms are worse at night, and he wakes with numbness in the bilateral hands. He experiences numbness in all fingers, but states it is the most noticeable in the left thumb and index finger. He affirms intermittent numbness in the left little finger. For relief, he shakes his hands upon waking. The patient also experiences weakness in his left hand. He reports he drops objects and explains “I have a hard time feeling it.”"

[doctor] same thing okay so you do have a bilateral positive tinel's sign so so here's here's where i'm at i think your your diagnosis is beginning to have some bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome usually we see that with repetitive actions such as the landscaping the heavy labor and you you know your your clinical exam and and history sound like it's a carpal tunnel syndrome i do want to order so where are we gon na go from here i would like to order a a study it's called an emg where it it measures some of that electrical impulses down into your fingers we will follow up with that but as far as your treatment so the treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is really some activity modification now i know you are a landscaper is there any way that you could be work to have some lighter work during the time
[patient] i suppose i could try to pass it off to some of my other employes and delegate
[doctor] okay that would be good so that's i i just want you to kinda eliminate that the active repetitive motions that you're doing all the time just for a couple weeks i'm also gon na give you a wrist splint to wear and that should help and i'd like you to take ibuprofen six hundred milligrams every six hours and then i wan na see you back here in the office in two weeks and in that two week period i think we're gon na see if there's need for any other intervention if i need to do more diagnostic testing or if there is a possibly looking at a surgical intervention to release that pressure that's on the nerves in that hand does that sound like a a good plan for you
[patient] yeah it sounds like a good first start
[doctor] okay okay so i i just just off off the record here what kind of what do what do you specialize in landscaping is your company do
[patient] mostly like yard work and maintenance flower beds not really designing just up keep
[doctor] okay yeah i'm looking for a landscape designer i need somebody to put in some elaborate walkways back through the backyard so yeah we can do stuff like that i mean if you have an idea what you want i think that's easy
[patient] okay
[doctor] you know if you're looking for like some
[patient] backyard elasis rehab remodel that's i mean i suppose we could do we have n't done things like that in a while because we're busy enough with just the up key but it's something to explore
[doctor] okay yeah i may have to keep that in mind because i do wan na do some of that so let's listen i'm gon na get my my nurse in here to discharge you do you have any other questions for me before we end this

Left wrist and hand pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

George Lewis is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of left wrist and hand pain. He reports an onset of a few months ago but denies any specific injury. However, the patient notes he often engages in repetitive motions while performing his work duties. His symptoms are worse at night, and he wakes with numbness in the bilateral hands. He experiences numbness in all fingers, but states it is the most noticeable in the left thumb and index finger. He affirms intermittent numbness in the left little finger. For relief, he shakes his hands upon waking. The patient also experiences weakness in his left hand. He reports he drops objects and explains “I have a hard time feeling it.”"

[patient] yeah i i i experienced some weakness in my left hand
[doctor] okay do you you find that you're dropping things when you're picking it up is it to that level or
[patient] yeah i drop things mostly because i have a hard time feeling it

[patient] yeah it sounds like a good first start
[doctor] okay okay so i i just just off off the record here what kind of what do what do you specialize in landscaping is your company do
[patient] mostly like yard work and maintenance flower beds not really designing just up keep
[doctor] okay yeah i'm looking for a landscape designer i need somebody to put in some elaborate walkways back through the backyard so yeah we can do stuff like that i mean if you have an idea what you want i think that's easy
[patient] okay
[doctor] you know if you're looking for like some
[patient] backyard elasis rehab remodel that's i mean i suppose we could do we have n't done things like that in a while because we're busy enough with just the up key but it's something to explore
[doctor] okay yeah i may have to keep that in mind because i do wan na do some of that so let's listen i'm gon na get my my nurse in here to discharge you do you have any other questions for me before we end this

He experiences numbness in all fingers, but states it is the most noticeable in the left thumb and index finger. He affirms intermittent numbness in the left little finger.

[patient] yeah i i i experienced some weakness in my left hand
[doctor] okay do you you find that you're dropping things when you're picking it up is it to that level or
[patient] yeah i drop things mostly because i have a hard time feeling it
[doctor] okay okay good and so you you do have a a grip strength is less on the left and i just wan na touch your fingers here on the on the right side you can feel me touching all the fingers on the right
[patient] yeah i can i can say you touch me but it feels a little more weird on the thumb side than my pointer finger side
[doctor] okay okay and i wan na turn your wrist over here and turn your hand over and i'm gon na go ahead and tap on the right wrist on the back here does that do anything when i do that

[patient] yeah it sounds like a good first start
[doctor] okay okay so i i just just off off the record here what kind of what do what do you specialize in landscaping is your company do
[patient] mostly like yard work and maintenance flower beds not really designing just up keep
[doctor] okay yeah i'm looking for a landscape designer i need somebody to put in some elaborate walkways back through the backyard so yeah we can do stuff like that i mean if you have an idea what you want i think that's easy
[patient] okay
[doctor] you know if you're looking for like some
[patient] backyard elasis rehab remodel that's i mean i suppose we could do we have n't done things like that in a while because we're busy enough with just the up key but it's something to explore
[doctor] okay yeah i may have to keep that in mind because i do wan na do some of that so let's listen i'm gon na get my my nurse in here to discharge you do you have any other questions for me before we end this

Left wrist and hand pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

George Lewis is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of left wrist and hand pain. He reports an onset of a few months ago but denies any specific injury. However, the patient notes he often engages in repetitive motions while performing his work duties. His symptoms are worse at night, and he wakes with numbness in the bilateral hands. He experiences numbness in all fingers, but states it is the most noticeable in the left thumb and index finger. He affirms intermittent numbness in the left little finger. For relief, he shakes his hands upon waking. The patient also experiences weakness in his left hand. He reports he drops objects and explains “I have a hard time feeling it.”"

[doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [patient] yes , i did . [doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine . the one that you prescribed as i'm still taking my old one , the price is a little high on the new one . [doctor] okay , so did , did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [patient] i did not try the coupon . there was a charge of $ 75 . [doctor] okay , well , next time that , that coupon should help , but it should only be about three dollars . [patient] okay . i do n't have it . do you happen to have another one you can give me ? [doctor] yep , right here . [patient] wonderful . thank you so much and and then the gel they are charging me $ 100 for it , so i do n't know if this is because it's a , it's walmart or if i should try somewhere else or maybe you know how or where i could get it cheaper . [doctor] yeah , let's try something else . sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication rather than the , the combined medication itself . [patient] that would be great . [doctor] so that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper so that we can do , the unithroid with the discount code should only be about nine dollars for 90 days . [patient] okay , that would be great , yeah , they were charging me $ 75 and i just could n't pay that . [doctor] maybe we try a different pharmacy as well . [patient] okay . so do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ? [doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it at least , so i would need to see the , the hyper and dragonism or high testosterone or a high dhea to cause acne or hair growth or any of that stuff , but the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [patient] okay . [doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said , your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [patient] you mentioned the weight loss study and you mentioned that i have some meal plans that you had given me , i still have those two . [doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then . [doctor] okay . [patient] so i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freeer since i'll be on vacation after july 8 . [doctor] okay , good . [patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla because it's supposed to help your metabolism , is that okay to take ? [doctor] i'm not sure , what is the cla ? [patient] i'm not sure what it is either . [doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so . [patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss . [doctor] so that likely will not help too much . you could try it either if you really want to but then they will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [patient] okay . [doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you . [doctor] it wo n't hurt like i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but it also wo n't help that much , so it's up to you . [patient] okay and so my cousin also suggested amino acids and that i might find them in certain foods i guess for my workout . [doctor] yeah , amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help you replenish and just kind of feel hydrated . [patient] okay , are they proteins , my cousin said she had lost some weight and has been working out every day but she does n't work , so i do n't know . [doctor] yes , i mean acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat with any protein , so meat , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . [patient] okay , thank you , got it . [doctor] alright are you allergic to any medications ? [patient] no , not that i know of . [doctor] okay . is your skin pretty sensitive ? [patient] yes . [doctor] alright . [patient] yeah , on my sides , i will start getting rashes with different products . [doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical as an antibiotic for your acne ? [patient] no , i've never tried anything for it . [doctor] okay . we may give you some of that . [patient] okay and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot . [doctor] okay . i'm , i'm gon na take a look at that for just a moment . any constipation ? [patient] yes , i also do have that problem . [doctor] alright . miralax will definitely help with that . [patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that . [doctor] great . alright , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright . deep breath , alright again . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright sounds good . [patient] great . [doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright , they look okay right now . certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . [patient] okay , i'll do that . [doctor] now let's go over your lab work . so when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing syndrome on that test at least . the salivary cortisol though unless you did one wrong , two of them were completely normal , one was abnormal , so we might need to repeat that in the future . [patient] okay , that's okay . [doctor] alright , so your cholesterol was quite high , the total cholesterol was 222 , good cholesterol was about 44 , the bad was 153 and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 and it was 44 . so your screening for diabetes is was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency and i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet or not . [patient] yes , we did . i , i do need to take one today though . [doctor] okay . so i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels , everything else seemed to be pretty good and in decent range . [patient] okay , that sounds great . so i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes because i have n't come back since then , but i was also happy because one of them was back to normal . [doctor] okay , great . let's see them . [patient] okay , so the one that's 30 that was almost 200 , not so long ago . [doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 . [patient] okay and , and back in october it was 254 . [doctor] yeah , this is much better . [patient] okay , great , and then it dropped in january and then it dropped a little more in march since i stopped taking the medicine in december . [doctor] okay , that's good . so i'm proud of you with the course of your labs so before i forget , i'm gon na just put your labs into the computer today and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time . [patient] okay . so with the thyroid and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ? [doctor] i do have a lot of people that have thyroid thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency . [patient] okay . [doctor] this is what i'm , i'm going to do , i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices . [patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs . [doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan . [patient] okay , good . so the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start or how does that work ? [doctor] so we are about to start as we just got approval last week and we are just waiting on our paperwork , so we can get started . [patient] okay and what's involved with that ? [doctor] so it'll involve you receiving a medication , which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety or satiety hormones . the most common side effects are gon na be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and constipation , there are six arms to the study , one is the placebo , the other ones are various , various dosages of the medication , excuse me , you would receive an injection once a week also keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance . [patient] okay . [doctor] so it's a way of getting them but the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor right might be only 1 out of 5 of our 100 patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . [patient] okay . [doctor] does that make sense ? [patient] yes , it does . [doctor] so we do expect pretty big weight loss because of what we learn in the diabetes study , so it's a year long process and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four or 5 weeks , i believe and then after that it's once a month . you do get a stype in for participating in the study and parking is validated and whatever else that you need for the study . [patient] okay , do you know how much the skypond is ? [doctor] i will have to double check for you and you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 if you do n't have any other medical condition or a bmi greater than 27 if you do have other medical condition like your cholesterol bmi greater than 27 would qualify you . [patient] i have a friend who might be interested and she does have diabetes . [doctor] if she has the diabetes , then she wo n't qualify . [patient] okay . you ca n't if you , if you have diabetes , got it . [doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that they can not have really is diabetes , severe psychiatric disease or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that . [patient] okay . [doctor] but if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that , they can definitely sign up . [patient] and they can , okay , thank you for explaining that . [doctor] of course , so do you want me to try to get you into that study or would you just like to try me to prescribe you something , it's kinda up to you . [patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now . [doctor] alright . sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research . it's just in my office . it is a different phone number though so then if you're interested , just call us within a month because i do n't know how long the , the wait will be . [patient] okay , we will do . [doctor] perfect . so let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card and then you use your insurance . then show them this and ask how much it will cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know . [patient] i will , thank you so much for your help on that . [doctor] you're welcome . then what i did is i gave you a topical antibiotic plus i gave you the benzyl peroxide so the peroxide may bleach your sheets . but you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day . [patient] okay , i can do that . [doctor] but you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets . [patient] okay , sounds good . [doctor] so that's that and then let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods and low cholesterol foods . [patient] okay . [doctor] and again once you finish your dose of vitamin d for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000 international units daily so that you're able to maintain those levels , sound good ? [patient] yes , that sounds great . [doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are gon na get better once you lose the weight though . [patient] okay , that would be great . [doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try one called fexie , which is kind of like a spermaside basically . [patient] okay . [doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse . [patient] okay . [doctor] if you need some just let me know . [patient] okay , i will , i will let you know . [doctor] okay , perfect . so stay put for me now . i'm gon na go see if they have a discount samples and bring you that prescription and then i'm going to order the labs for next time . [patient] okay , great . thank you so much . [doctor] you're welcome . so under the plan under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal , 2 out of 3 solid chorisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's and therefore , ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we will try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin and remove the previous information on the hypothyroidism . we will print out her prescriptions unithyroid should be better priced with the discount card and we will repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female who presents today for evaluation and management of abnormal liver enzymes and hypothyroidism.

When the patient was last seen, her thyroid medicine was changed to Unithroid, but due to the cost of $75, she has not yet started the new medicine and continues taking her previous thyroid medicine. She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.

Mrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.

The patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.

She denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products."

[doctor] yeah , let's try something else . sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication rather than the , the combined medication itself . [patient] that would be great . [doctor] so that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper so that we can do , the unithroid with the discount code should only be about nine dollars for 90 days . [patient] okay , that would be great , yeah , they were charging me $ 75 and i just could n't pay that . [doctor] maybe we try a different pharmacy as well . [patient] okay . so do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ? [doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it at least , so i would need to see the , the hyper and dragonism or high testosterone or a high dhea to cause acne or hair growth or any of that stuff , but the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [patient] okay . [doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said , your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [patient] you mentioned the weight loss study and you mentioned that i have some meal plans that you had given me , i still have those two . [doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then . [doctor] okay . [patient] so i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freeer since i'll be on vacation after july 8 . [doctor] okay , good . [patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla because it's supposed to help your metabolism , is that okay to take ? [doctor] i'm not sure , what is the cla ? [patient] i'm not sure what it is either . [doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so . [patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss . [doctor] so that likely will not help too much . you could try it either if you really want to but then they will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [patient] okay . [doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you . [doctor] it wo n't hurt like i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but it also wo n't help that much , so it's up to you . [patient] okay and so my cousin also suggested amino acids and that i might find them in certain foods i guess for my workout . [doctor] yeah , amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help you replenish and just kind of feel hydrated . [patient] okay , are they proteins , my cousin said she had lost some weight and has been working out every day but she does n't work , so i do n't know . [doctor] yes , i mean acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat with any protein , so meat , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . [patient] okay , thank you , got it . [doctor] alright are you allergic to any medications ? [patient] no , not that i know of . [doctor] okay . is your skin pretty sensitive ? [patient] yes . [doctor] alright . [patient] yeah , on my sides , i will start getting rashes with different products . [doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical as an antibiotic for your acne ? [patient] no , i've never tried anything for it . [doctor] okay . we may give you some of that . [patient] okay and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot . [doctor] okay . i'm , i'm gon na take a look at that for just a moment . any constipation ? [patient] yes , i also do have that problem . [doctor] alright . miralax will definitely help with that . [patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that . [doctor] great . alright , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright . deep breath , alright again . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright sounds good . [patient] great . [doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright , they look okay right now . certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . [patient] okay , i'll do that . [doctor] now let's go over your lab work . so when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing syndrome on that test at least . the salivary cortisol though unless you did one wrong , two of them were completely normal , one was abnormal , so we might need to repeat that in the future . [patient] okay , that's okay . [doctor] alright , so your cholesterol was quite high , the total cholesterol was 222 , good cholesterol was about 44 , the bad was 153 and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 and it was 44 . so your screening for diabetes is was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency and i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet or not . [patient] yes , we did . i , i do need to take one today though . [doctor] okay . so i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels , everything else seemed to be pretty good and in decent range . [patient] okay , that sounds great . so i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes because i have n't come back since then , but i was also happy because one of them was back to normal . [doctor] okay , great . let's see them . [patient] okay , so the one that's 30 that was almost 200 , not so long ago . [doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 . [patient] okay and , and back in october it was 254 . [doctor] yeah , this is much better . [patient] okay , great , and then it dropped in january and then it dropped a little more in march since i stopped taking the medicine in december . [doctor] okay , that's good . so i'm proud of you with the course of your labs so before i forget , i'm gon na just put your labs into the computer today and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time . [patient] okay . so with the thyroid and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ? [doctor] i do have a lot of people that have thyroid thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency . [patient] okay . [doctor] this is what i'm , i'm going to do , i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices . [patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs . [doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan . [patient] okay , good . so the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start or how does that work ? [doctor] so we are about to start as we just got approval last week and we are just waiting on our paperwork , so we can get started . [patient] okay and what's involved with that ? [doctor] so it'll involve you receiving a medication , which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety or satiety hormones . the most common side effects are gon na be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and constipation , there are six arms to the study , one is the placebo , the other ones are various , various dosages of the medication , excuse me , you would receive an injection once a week also keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance . [patient] okay . [doctor] so it's a way of getting them but the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor right might be only 1 out of 5 of our 100 patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . [patient] okay . [doctor] does that make sense ? [patient] yes , it does . [doctor] so we do expect pretty big weight loss because of what we learn in the diabetes study , so it's a year long process and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four or 5 weeks , i believe and then after that it's once a month . you do get a stype in for participating in the study and parking is validated and whatever else that you need for the study . [patient] okay , do you know how much the skypond is ? [doctor] i will have to double check for you and you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 if you do n't have any other medical condition or a bmi greater than 27 if you do have other medical condition like your cholesterol bmi greater than 27 would qualify you . [patient] i have a friend who might be interested and she does have diabetes . [doctor] if she has the diabetes , then she wo n't qualify . [patient] okay . you ca n't if you , if you have diabetes , got it . [doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that they can not have really is diabetes , severe psychiatric disease or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that . [patient] okay . [doctor] but if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that , they can definitely sign up . [patient] and they can , okay , thank you for explaining that . [doctor] of course , so do you want me to try to get you into that study or would you just like to try me to prescribe you something , it's kinda up to you . [patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now . [doctor] alright . sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research . it's just in my office . it is a different phone number though so then if you're interested , just call us within a month because i do n't know how long the , the wait will be . [patient] okay , we will do . [doctor] perfect . so let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card and then you use your insurance . then show them this and ask how much it will cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know . [patient] i will , thank you so much for your help on that . [doctor] you're welcome . then what i did is i gave you a topical antibiotic plus i gave you the benzyl peroxide so the peroxide may bleach your sheets . but you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day . [patient] okay , i can do that . [doctor] but you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets . [patient] okay , sounds good . [doctor] so that's that and then let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods and low cholesterol foods . [patient] okay . [doctor] and again once you finish your dose of vitamin d for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000 international units daily so that you're able to maintain those levels , sound good ? [patient] yes , that sounds great . [doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are gon na get better once you lose the weight though . [patient] okay , that would be great . [doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try one called fexie , which is kind of like a spermaside basically . [patient] okay . [doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse . [patient] okay . [doctor] if you need some just let me know . [patient] okay , i will , i will let you know . [doctor] okay , perfect . so stay put for me now . i'm gon na go see if they have a discount samples and bring you that prescription and then i'm going to order the labs for next time . [patient] okay , great . thank you so much . [doctor] you're welcome . so under the plan under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal , 2 out of 3 solid chorisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's and therefore , ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we will try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin and remove the previous information on the hypothyroidism . we will print out her prescriptions unithyroid should be better priced with the discount card and we will repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female who presents today for evaluation and management of abnormal liver enzymes and hypothyroidism.

When the patient was last seen, her thyroid medicine was changed to Unithroid, but due to the cost of $75, she has not yet started the new medicine and continues taking her previous thyroid medicine. She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.

Mrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.

The patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.

She denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products."

[patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla because it's supposed to help your metabolism , is that okay to take ? [doctor] i'm not sure , what is the cla ? [patient] i'm not sure what it is either . [doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so . [patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss . [doctor] so that likely will not help too much . you could try it either if you really want to but then they will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [patient] okay . [doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you . [doctor] it wo n't hurt like i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but it also wo n't help that much , so it's up to you . [patient] okay and so my cousin also suggested amino acids and that i might find them in certain foods i guess for my workout . [doctor] yeah , amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help you replenish and just kind of feel hydrated . [patient] okay , are they proteins , my cousin said she had lost some weight and has been working out every day but she does n't work , so i do n't know . [doctor] yes , i mean acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat with any protein , so meat , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . [patient] okay , thank you , got it . [doctor] alright are you allergic to any medications ? [patient] no , not that i know of . [doctor] okay . is your skin pretty sensitive ? [patient] yes . [doctor] alright . [patient] yeah , on my sides , i will start getting rashes with different products . [doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical as an antibiotic for your acne ? [patient] no , i've never tried anything for it . [doctor] okay . we may give you some of that . [patient] okay and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot . [doctor] okay . i'm , i'm gon na take a look at that for just a moment . any constipation ? [patient] yes , i also do have that problem . [doctor] alright . miralax will definitely help with that . [patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that . [doctor] great . alright , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright . deep breath , alright again . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright sounds good . [patient] great . [doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright , they look okay right now . certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . [patient] okay , i'll do that . [doctor] now let's go over your lab work . so when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing syndrome on that test at least . the salivary cortisol though unless you did one wrong , two of them were completely normal , one was abnormal , so we might need to repeat that in the future . [patient] okay , that's okay . [doctor] alright , so your cholesterol was quite high , the total cholesterol was 222 , good cholesterol was about 44 , the bad was 153 and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 and it was 44 . so your screening for diabetes is was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency and i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet or not . [patient] yes , we did . i , i do need to take one today though . [doctor] okay . so i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels , everything else seemed to be pretty good and in decent range . [patient] okay , that sounds great . so i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes because i have n't come back since then , but i was also happy because one of them was back to normal . [doctor] okay , great . let's see them . [patient] okay , so the one that's 30 that was almost 200 , not so long ago . [doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 . [patient] okay and , and back in october it was 254 . [doctor] yeah , this is much better . [patient] okay , great , and then it dropped in january and then it dropped a little more in march since i stopped taking the medicine in december . [doctor] okay , that's good . so i'm proud of you with the course of your labs so before i forget , i'm gon na just put your labs into the computer today and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time . [patient] okay . so with the thyroid and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ? [doctor] i do have a lot of people that have thyroid thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency . [patient] okay . [doctor] this is what i'm , i'm going to do , i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices . [patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs . [doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan . [patient] okay , good . so the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start or how does that work ? [doctor] so we are about to start as we just got approval last week and we are just waiting on our paperwork , so we can get started . [patient] okay and what's involved with that ? [doctor] so it'll involve you receiving a medication , which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety or satiety hormones . the most common side effects are gon na be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and constipation , there are six arms to the study , one is the placebo , the other ones are various , various dosages of the medication , excuse me , you would receive an injection once a week also keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance . [patient] okay . [doctor] so it's a way of getting them but the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor right might be only 1 out of 5 of our 100 patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . [patient] okay . [doctor] does that make sense ? [patient] yes , it does . [doctor] so we do expect pretty big weight loss because of what we learn in the diabetes study , so it's a year long process and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four or 5 weeks , i believe and then after that it's once a month . you do get a stype in for participating in the study and parking is validated and whatever else that you need for the study . [patient] okay , do you know how much the skypond is ? [doctor] i will have to double check for you and you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 if you do n't have any other medical condition or a bmi greater than 27 if you do have other medical condition like your cholesterol bmi greater than 27 would qualify you . [patient] i have a friend who might be interested and she does have diabetes . [doctor] if she has the diabetes , then she wo n't qualify . [patient] okay . you ca n't if you , if you have diabetes , got it . [doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that they can not have really is diabetes , severe psychiatric disease or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that . [patient] okay . [doctor] but if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that , they can definitely sign up . [patient] and they can , okay , thank you for explaining that . [doctor] of course , so do you want me to try to get you into that study or would you just like to try me to prescribe you something , it's kinda up to you . [patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now . [doctor] alright . sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research . it's just in my office . it is a different phone number though so then if you're interested , just call us within a month because i do n't know how long the , the wait will be . [patient] okay , we will do . [doctor] perfect . so let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card and then you use your insurance . then show them this and ask how much it will cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know . [patient] i will , thank you so much for your help on that . [doctor] you're welcome . then what i did is i gave you a topical antibiotic plus i gave you the benzyl peroxide so the peroxide may bleach your sheets . but you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day . [patient] okay , i can do that . [doctor] but you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets . [patient] okay , sounds good . [doctor] so that's that and then let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods and low cholesterol foods . [patient] okay . [doctor] and again once you finish your dose of vitamin d for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000 international units daily so that you're able to maintain those levels , sound good ? [patient] yes , that sounds great . [doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are gon na get better once you lose the weight though . [patient] okay , that would be great . [doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try one called fexie , which is kind of like a spermaside basically . [patient] okay . [doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse . [patient] okay . [doctor] if you need some just let me know . [patient] okay , i will , i will let you know . [doctor] okay , perfect . so stay put for me now . i'm gon na go see if they have a discount samples and bring you that prescription and then i'm going to order the labs for next time . [patient] okay , great . thank you so much . [doctor] you're welcome . so under the plan under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal , 2 out of 3 solid chorisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's and therefore , ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we will try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin and remove the previous information on the hypothyroidism . we will print out her prescriptions unithyroid should be better priced with the discount card and we will repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female who presents today for evaluation and management of abnormal liver enzymes and hypothyroidism.

When the patient was last seen, her thyroid medicine was changed to Unithroid, but due to the cost of $75, she has not yet started the new medicine and continues taking her previous thyroid medicine. She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.

Mrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.

The patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.

She denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products."
src_experiment_data,5,"[doctor] next patient is christine hernandez . date of birth is january 13 , 1982 . hey miss christine , how are you doing today ? [patient] i'm good , thanks , how are you ? [doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [patient] yes , i did . [doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine . the one that you prescribed as i'm still taking my old one , the price is a little high on the new one . [doctor] okay , so did , did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [patient] i did not try the coupon . there was a charge of $ 75 . [doctor] okay , well , next time that , that coupon should help , but it should only be about three dollars . [patient] okay . i do n't have it . do you happen to have another one you can give me ? [doctor] yep , right here . [patient] wonderful . thank you so much and and then the gel they are charging me $ 100 for it , so i do n't know if this is because it's a , it's walmart or if i should try somewhere else or maybe you know how or where i could get it cheaper . [doctor] yeah , let's try something else . sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication rather than the , the combined medication itself . [patient] that would be great . [doctor] so that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper so that we can do , the unithroid with the discount code should only be about nine dollars for 90 days . [patient] okay , that would be great , yeah , they were charging me $ 75 and i just could n't pay that . [doctor] maybe we try a different pharmacy as well . [patient] okay . so do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ? [doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it at least , so i would need to see the , the hyper and dragonism or high testosterone or a high dhea to cause acne or hair growth or any of that stuff , but the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [patient] okay . [doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said , your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [patient] you mentioned the weight loss study and you mentioned that i have some meal plans that you had given me , i still have those two .

[patient] yeah , on my sides , i will start getting rashes with different products . [doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical as an antibiotic for your acne ? [patient] no , i've never tried anything for it . [doctor] okay . we may give you some of that . [patient] okay and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot . [doctor] okay . i'm , i'm gon na take a look at that for just a moment . any constipation ? [patient] yes , i also do have that problem . [doctor] alright . miralax will definitely help with that . [patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that . [doctor] great . alright , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright . deep breath , alright again . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright sounds good . [patient] great . [doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright , they look okay right now . certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . [patient] okay , i'll do that . [doctor] now let's go over your lab work . so when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing syndrome on that test at least . the salivary cortisol though unless you did one wrong , two of them were completely normal , one was abnormal , so we might need to repeat that in the future . [patient] okay , that's okay . [doctor] alright , so your cholesterol was quite high , the total cholesterol was 222 , good cholesterol was about 44 , the bad was 153 and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 and it was 44 . so your screening for diabetes is was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency and i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet or not . [patient] yes , we did . i , i do need to take one today though . [doctor] okay . so i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels , everything else seemed to be pretty good and in decent range . [patient] okay , that sounds great . so i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes because i have n't come back since then , but i was also happy because one of them was back to normal . [doctor] okay , great . let's see them . [patient] okay , so the one that's 30 that was almost 200 , not so long ago . [doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 . [patient] okay and , and back in october it was 254 . [doctor] yeah , this is much better . [patient] okay , great , and then it dropped in january and then it dropped a little more in march since i stopped taking the medicine in december . [doctor] okay , that's good . so i'm proud of you with the course of your labs so before i forget , i'm gon na just put your labs into the computer today and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time . [patient] okay . so with the thyroid and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ? [doctor] i do have a lot of people that have thyroid thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency . [patient] okay . [doctor] this is what i'm , i'm going to do , i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices . [patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs . [doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan . [patient] okay , good . so the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start or how does that work ? [doctor] so we are about to start as we just got approval last week and we are just waiting on our paperwork , so we can get started . [patient] okay and what's involved with that ? [doctor] so it'll involve you receiving a medication , which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety or satiety hormones . the most common side effects are gon na be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and constipation , there are six arms to the study , one is the placebo , the other ones are various , various dosages of the medication , excuse me , you would receive an injection once a week also keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance . [patient] okay . [doctor] so it's a way of getting them but the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor right might be only 1 out of 5 of our 100 patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . [patient] okay . [doctor] does that make sense ? [patient] yes , it does . [doctor] so we do expect pretty big weight loss because of what we learn in the diabetes study , so it's a year long process and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four or 5 weeks , i believe and then after that it's once a month . you do get a stype in for participating in the study and parking is validated and whatever else that you need for the study . [patient] okay , do you know how much the skypond is ? [doctor] i will have to double check for you and you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 if you do n't have any other medical condition or a bmi greater than 27 if you do have other medical condition like your cholesterol bmi greater than 27 would qualify you . [patient] i have a friend who might be interested and she does have diabetes . [doctor] if she has the diabetes , then she wo n't qualify . [patient] okay . you ca n't if you , if you have diabetes , got it . [doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that they can not have really is diabetes , severe psychiatric disease or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that . [patient] okay . [doctor] but if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that , they can definitely sign up . [patient] and they can , okay , thank you for explaining that . [doctor] of course , so do you want me to try to get you into that study or would you just like to try me to prescribe you something , it's kinda up to you . [patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now . [doctor] alright . sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research . it's just in my office . it is a different phone number though so then if you're interested , just call us within a month because i do n't know how long the , the wait will be . [patient] okay , we will do . [doctor] perfect . so let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card and then you use your insurance . then show them this and ask how much it will cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know . [patient] i will , thank you so much for your help on that . [doctor] you're welcome . then what i did is i gave you a topical antibiotic plus i gave you the benzyl peroxide so the peroxide may bleach your sheets . but you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day . [patient] okay , i can do that . [doctor] but you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets . [patient] okay , sounds good . [doctor] so that's that and then let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods and low cholesterol foods . [patient] okay . [doctor] and again once you finish your dose of vitamin d for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000 international units daily so that you're able to maintain those levels , sound good ? [patient] yes , that sounds great . [doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are gon na get better once you lose the weight though . [patient] okay , that would be great . [doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try one called fexie , which is kind of like a spermaside basically . [patient] okay . [doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse . [patient] okay . [doctor] if you need some just let me know . [patient] okay , i will , i will let you know . [doctor] okay , perfect . so stay put for me now . i'm gon na go see if they have a discount samples and bring you that prescription and then i'm going to order the labs for next time . [patient] okay , great . thank you so much . [doctor] you're welcome . so under the plan under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal , 2 out of 3 solid chorisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's and therefore , ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we will try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin and remove the previous information on the hypothyroidism . we will print out her prescriptions unithyroid should be better priced with the discount card and we will repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female who presents today for evaluation and management of abnormal liver enzymes and hypothyroidism.

When the patient was last seen, her thyroid medicine was changed to Unithroid, but due to the cost of $75, she has not yet started the new medicine and continues taking her previous thyroid medicine. She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.

Mrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.

The patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.

She denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products."
src_experiment_data,7,"[doctor] next patient is christine hernandez . date of birth is january 13 , 1982 . hey miss christine , how are you doing today ? [patient] i'm good , thanks , how are you ? [doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [patient] yes , i did . [doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine . the one that you prescribed as i'm still taking my old one , the price is a little high on the new one . [doctor] okay , so did , did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [patient] i did not try the coupon . there was a charge of $ 75 . [doctor] okay , well , next time that , that coupon should help , but it should only be about three dollars . [patient] okay . i do n't have it . do you happen to have another one you can give me ? [doctor] yep , right here . [patient] wonderful . thank you so much and and then the gel they are charging me $ 100 for it , so i do n't know if this is because it's a , it's walmart or if i should try somewhere else or maybe you know how or where i could get it cheaper . [doctor] yeah , let's try something else . sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication rather than the , the combined medication itself . [patient] that would be great . [doctor] so that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper so that we can do , the unithroid with the discount code should only be about nine dollars for 90 days . [patient] okay , that would be great , yeah , they were charging me $ 75 and i just could n't pay that . [doctor] maybe we try a different pharmacy as well . [patient] okay . so do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ? [doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it at least , so i would need to see the , the hyper and dragonism or high testosterone or a high dhea to cause acne or hair growth or any of that stuff , but the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [patient] okay . [doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said , your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [patient] you mentioned the weight loss study and you mentioned that i have some meal plans that you had given me , i still have those two . [doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then . [doctor] okay . [patient] so i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freeer since i'll be on vacation after july 8 . [doctor] okay , good . [patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla because it's supposed to help your metabolism , is that okay to take ? [doctor] i'm not sure , what is the cla ? [patient] i'm not sure what it is either . [doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so . [patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss . [doctor] so that likely will not help too much . you could try it either if you really want to but then they will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [patient] okay . [doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you . [doctor] it wo n't hurt like i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but it also wo n't help that much , so it's up to you . [patient] okay and so my cousin also suggested amino acids and that i might find them in certain foods i guess for my workout . [doctor] yeah , amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help you replenish and just kind of feel hydrated . [patient] okay , are they proteins , my cousin said she had lost some weight and has been working out every day but she does n't work , so i do n't know . [doctor] yes , i mean acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat with any protein , so meat , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . [patient] okay , thank you , got it . [doctor] alright are you allergic to any medications ? [patient] no , not that i know of . [doctor] okay . is your skin pretty sensitive ? [patient] yes . [doctor] alright .

[doctor] alright , so your cholesterol was quite high , the total cholesterol was 222 , good cholesterol was about 44 , the bad was 153 and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 and it was 44 . so your screening for diabetes is was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency and i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet or not . [patient] yes , we did . i , i do need to take one today though . [doctor] okay . so i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels , everything else seemed to be pretty good and in decent range . [patient] okay , that sounds great . so i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes because i have n't come back since then , but i was also happy because one of them was back to normal . [doctor] okay , great . let's see them . [patient] okay , so the one that's 30 that was almost 200 , not so long ago . [doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 . [patient] okay and , and back in october it was 254 . [doctor] yeah , this is much better . [patient] okay , great , and then it dropped in january and then it dropped a little more in march since i stopped taking the medicine in december . [doctor] okay , that's good . so i'm proud of you with the course of your labs so before i forget , i'm gon na just put your labs into the computer today and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time . [patient] okay . so with the thyroid and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ? [doctor] i do have a lot of people that have thyroid thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency . [patient] okay . [doctor] this is what i'm , i'm going to do , i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices . [patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs . [doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan . [patient] okay , good . so the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start or how does that work ? [doctor] so we are about to start as we just got approval last week and we are just waiting on our paperwork , so we can get started . [patient] okay and what's involved with that ? [doctor] so it'll involve you receiving a medication , which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety or satiety hormones . the most common side effects are gon na be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and constipation , there are six arms to the study , one is the placebo , the other ones are various , various dosages of the medication , excuse me , you would receive an injection once a week also keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance . [patient] okay . [doctor] so it's a way of getting them but the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor right might be only 1 out of 5 of our 100 patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . [patient] okay . [doctor] does that make sense ? [patient] yes , it does . [doctor] so we do expect pretty big weight loss because of what we learn in the diabetes study , so it's a year long process and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four or 5 weeks , i believe and then after that it's once a month . you do get a stype in for participating in the study and parking is validated and whatever else that you need for the study . [patient] okay , do you know how much the skypond is ? [doctor] i will have to double check for you and you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 if you do n't have any other medical condition or a bmi greater than 27 if you do have other medical condition like your cholesterol bmi greater than 27 would qualify you . [patient] i have a friend who might be interested and she does have diabetes . [doctor] if she has the diabetes , then she wo n't qualify . [patient] okay . you ca n't if you , if you have diabetes , got it . [doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that they can not have really is diabetes , severe psychiatric disease or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that . [patient] okay . [doctor] but if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that , they can definitely sign up . [patient] and they can , okay , thank you for explaining that . [doctor] of course , so do you want me to try to get you into that study or would you just like to try me to prescribe you something , it's kinda up to you . [patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now . [doctor] alright . sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research . it's just in my office . it is a different phone number though so then if you're interested , just call us within a month because i do n't know how long the , the wait will be . [patient] okay , we will do . [doctor] perfect . so let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card and then you use your insurance . then show them this and ask how much it will cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know . [patient] i will , thank you so much for your help on that . [doctor] you're welcome . then what i did is i gave you a topical antibiotic plus i gave you the benzyl peroxide so the peroxide may bleach your sheets . but you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day . [patient] okay , i can do that . [doctor] but you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets . [patient] okay , sounds good . [doctor] so that's that and then let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods and low cholesterol foods . [patient] okay . [doctor] and again once you finish your dose of vitamin d for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000 international units daily so that you're able to maintain those levels , sound good ? [patient] yes , that sounds great . [doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are gon na get better once you lose the weight though . [patient] okay , that would be great . [doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try one called fexie , which is kind of like a spermaside basically . [patient] okay . [doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse . [patient] okay . [doctor] if you need some just let me know . [patient] okay , i will , i will let you know . [doctor] okay , perfect . so stay put for me now . i'm gon na go see if they have a discount samples and bring you that prescription and then i'm going to order the labs for next time . [patient] okay , great . thank you so much . [doctor] you're welcome . so under the plan under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal , 2 out of 3 solid chorisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's and therefore , ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we will try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin and remove the previous information on the hypothyroidism . we will print out her prescriptions unithyroid should be better priced with the discount card and we will repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female who presents today for evaluation and management of abnormal liver enzymes and hypothyroidism.

When the patient was last seen, her thyroid medicine was changed to Unithroid, but due to the cost of $75, she has not yet started the new medicine and continues taking her previous thyroid medicine. She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.

Mrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.

The patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.

She denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products."
src_experiment_data,9,"[doctor] next patient is christine hernandez . date of birth is january 13 , 1982 . hey miss christine , how are you doing today ? [patient] i'm good , thanks , how are you ? [doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [patient] yes , i did . [doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine . the one that you prescribed as i'm still taking my old one , the price is a little high on the new one . [doctor] okay , so did , did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [patient] i did not try the coupon . there was a charge of $ 75 . [doctor] okay , well , next time that , that coupon should help , but it should only be about three dollars . [patient] okay . i do n't have it . do you happen to have another one you can give me ? [doctor] yep , right here . [patient] wonderful . thank you so much and and then the gel they are charging me $ 100 for it , so i do n't know if this is because it's a , it's walmart or if i should try somewhere else or maybe you know how or where i could get it cheaper . [doctor] yeah , let's try something else . sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication rather than the , the combined medication itself . [patient] that would be great . [doctor] so that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper so that we can do , the unithroid with the discount code should only be about nine dollars for 90 days . [patient] okay , that would be great , yeah , they were charging me $ 75 and i just could n't pay that . [doctor] maybe we try a different pharmacy as well . [patient] okay . so do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ? [doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it at least , so i would need to see the , the hyper and dragonism or high testosterone or a high dhea to cause acne or hair growth or any of that stuff , but the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [patient] okay . [doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said , your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [patient] you mentioned the weight loss study and you mentioned that i have some meal plans that you had given me , i still have those two . [doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then . [doctor] okay . [patient] so i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freeer since i'll be on vacation after july 8 . [doctor] okay , good . [patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla because it's supposed to help your metabolism , is that okay to take ? [doctor] i'm not sure , what is the cla ? [patient] i'm not sure what it is either . [doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so . [patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss . [doctor] so that likely will not help too much . you could try it either if you really want to but then they will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [patient] okay . [doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you . [doctor] it wo n't hurt like i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but it also wo n't help that much , so it's up to you . [patient] okay and so my cousin also suggested amino acids and that i might find them in certain foods i guess for my workout . [doctor] yeah , amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help you replenish and just kind of feel hydrated . [patient] okay , are they proteins , my cousin said she had lost some weight and has been working out every day but she does n't work , so i do n't know . [doctor] yes , i mean acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat with any protein , so meat , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . [patient] okay , thank you , got it . [doctor] alright are you allergic to any medications ? [patient] no , not that i know of . [doctor] okay . is your skin pretty sensitive ? [patient] yes . [doctor] alright . [patient] yeah , on my sides , i will start getting rashes with different products . [doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical as an antibiotic for your acne ? [patient] no , i've never tried anything for it . [doctor] okay . we may give you some of that . [patient] okay and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot . [doctor] okay . i'm , i'm gon na take a look at that for just a moment . any constipation ? [patient] yes , i also do have that problem . [doctor] alright . miralax will definitely help with that . [patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that . [doctor] great . alright , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright . deep breath , alright again . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright sounds good . [patient] great . [doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright , they look okay right now . certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . [patient] okay , i'll do that . [doctor] now let's go over your lab work . so when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing syndrome on that test at least . the salivary cortisol though unless you did one wrong , two of them were completely normal , one was abnormal , so we might need to repeat that in the future .

[doctor] i do have a lot of people that have thyroid thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency . [patient] okay . [doctor] this is what i'm , i'm going to do , i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices . [patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs . [doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan . [patient] okay , good . so the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start or how does that work ? [doctor] so we are about to start as we just got approval last week and we are just waiting on our paperwork , so we can get started . [patient] okay and what's involved with that ? [doctor] so it'll involve you receiving a medication , which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety or satiety hormones . the most common side effects are gon na be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and constipation , there are six arms to the study , one is the placebo , the other ones are various , various dosages of the medication , excuse me , you would receive an injection once a week also keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance . [patient] okay . [doctor] so it's a way of getting them but the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor right might be only 1 out of 5 of our 100 patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . [patient] okay . [doctor] does that make sense ? [patient] yes , it does . [doctor] so we do expect pretty big weight loss because of what we learn in the diabetes study , so it's a year long process and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four or 5 weeks , i believe and then after that it's once a month . you do get a stype in for participating in the study and parking is validated and whatever else that you need for the study . [patient] okay , do you know how much the skypond is ? [doctor] i will have to double check for you and you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 if you do n't have any other medical condition or a bmi greater than 27 if you do have other medical condition like your cholesterol bmi greater than 27 would qualify you . [patient] i have a friend who might be interested and she does have diabetes . [doctor] if she has the diabetes , then she wo n't qualify . [patient] okay . you ca n't if you , if you have diabetes , got it . [doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that they can not have really is diabetes , severe psychiatric disease or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that . [patient] okay . [doctor] but if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that , they can definitely sign up . [patient] and they can , okay , thank you for explaining that . [doctor] of course , so do you want me to try to get you into that study or would you just like to try me to prescribe you something , it's kinda up to you . [patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now . [doctor] alright . sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research . it's just in my office . it is a different phone number though so then if you're interested , just call us within a month because i do n't know how long the , the wait will be . [patient] okay , we will do . [doctor] perfect . so let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card and then you use your insurance . then show them this and ask how much it will cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know . [patient] i will , thank you so much for your help on that . [doctor] you're welcome . then what i did is i gave you a topical antibiotic plus i gave you the benzyl peroxide so the peroxide may bleach your sheets . but you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day . [patient] okay , i can do that . [doctor] but you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets . [patient] okay , sounds good . [doctor] so that's that and then let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods and low cholesterol foods . [patient] okay . [doctor] and again once you finish your dose of vitamin d for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000 international units daily so that you're able to maintain those levels , sound good ? [patient] yes , that sounds great . [doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are gon na get better once you lose the weight though . [patient] okay , that would be great . [doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try one called fexie , which is kind of like a spermaside basically . [patient] okay . [doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse . [patient] okay . [doctor] if you need some just let me know . [patient] okay , i will , i will let you know . [doctor] okay , perfect . so stay put for me now . i'm gon na go see if they have a discount samples and bring you that prescription and then i'm going to order the labs for next time . [patient] okay , great . thank you so much . [doctor] you're welcome . so under the plan under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal , 2 out of 3 solid chorisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's and therefore , ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we will try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin and remove the previous information on the hypothyroidism . we will print out her prescriptions unithyroid should be better priced with the discount card and we will repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female who presents today for evaluation and management of abnormal liver enzymes and hypothyroidism.

When the patient was last seen, her thyroid medicine was changed to Unithroid, but due to the cost of $75, she has not yet started the new medicine and continues taking her previous thyroid medicine. She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.

Mrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.

The patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.

She denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products."
src_experiment_data,11,"[doctor] next patient is christine hernandez . date of birth is january 13 , 1982 . hey miss christine , how are you doing today ? [patient] i'm good , thanks , how are you ? [doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [patient] yes , i did . [doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine . the one that you prescribed as i'm still taking my old one , the price is a little high on the new one . [doctor] okay , so did , did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [patient] i did not try the coupon . there was a charge of $ 75 . [doctor] okay , well , next time that , that coupon should help , but it should only be about three dollars . [patient] okay . i do n't have it . do you happen to have another one you can give me ? [doctor] yep , right here . [patient] wonderful . thank you so much and and then the gel they are charging me $ 100 for it , so i do n't know if this is because it's a , it's walmart or if i should try somewhere else or maybe you know how or where i could get it cheaper . [doctor] yeah , let's try something else . sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication rather than the , the combined medication itself . [patient] that would be great . [doctor] so that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper so that we can do , the unithroid with the discount code should only be about nine dollars for 90 days . [patient] okay , that would be great , yeah , they were charging me $ 75 and i just could n't pay that . [doctor] maybe we try a different pharmacy as well . [patient] okay . so do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ? [doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it at least , so i would need to see the , the hyper and dragonism or high testosterone or a high dhea to cause acne or hair growth or any of that stuff , but the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [patient] okay . [doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said , your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [patient] you mentioned the weight loss study and you mentioned that i have some meal plans that you had given me , i still have those two . [doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then . [doctor] okay . [patient] so i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freeer since i'll be on vacation after july 8 . [doctor] okay , good . [patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla because it's supposed to help your metabolism , is that okay to take ? [doctor] i'm not sure , what is the cla ? [patient] i'm not sure what it is either . [doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so . [patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss . [doctor] so that likely will not help too much . you could try it either if you really want to but then they will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [patient] okay . [doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you . [doctor] it wo n't hurt like i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but it also wo n't help that much , so it's up to you . [patient] okay and so my cousin also suggested amino acids and that i might find them in certain foods i guess for my workout . [doctor] yeah , amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help you replenish and just kind of feel hydrated . [patient] okay , are they proteins , my cousin said she had lost some weight and has been working out every day but she does n't work , so i do n't know . [doctor] yes , i mean acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat with any protein , so meat , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . [patient] okay , thank you , got it . [doctor] alright are you allergic to any medications ? [patient] no , not that i know of . [doctor] okay . is your skin pretty sensitive ? [patient] yes . [doctor] alright . [patient] yeah , on my sides , i will start getting rashes with different products . [doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical as an antibiotic for your acne ? [patient] no , i've never tried anything for it . [doctor] okay . we may give you some of that . [patient] okay and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot . [doctor] okay . i'm , i'm gon na take a look at that for just a moment . any constipation ? [patient] yes , i also do have that problem . [doctor] alright . miralax will definitely help with that . [patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that . [doctor] great . alright , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright . deep breath , alright again . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright sounds good . [patient] great . [doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright , they look okay right now . certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . [patient] okay , i'll do that . [doctor] now let's go over your lab work . so when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing syndrome on that test at least . the salivary cortisol though unless you did one wrong , two of them were completely normal , one was abnormal , so we might need to repeat that in the future . [patient] okay , that's okay . [doctor] alright , so your cholesterol was quite high , the total cholesterol was 222 , good cholesterol was about 44 , the bad was 153 and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 and it was 44 . so your screening for diabetes is was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency and i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet or not . [patient] yes , we did . i , i do need to take one today though . [doctor] okay . so i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels , everything else seemed to be pretty good and in decent range . [patient] okay , that sounds great . so i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes because i have n't come back since then , but i was also happy because one of them was back to normal . [doctor] okay , great . let's see them . [patient] okay , so the one that's 30 that was almost 200 , not so long ago . [doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 . [patient] okay and , and back in october it was 254 . [doctor] yeah , this is much better . [patient] okay , great , and then it dropped in january and then it dropped a little more in march since i stopped taking the medicine in december . [doctor] okay , that's good . so i'm proud of you with the course of your labs so before i forget , i'm gon na just put your labs into the computer today and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time . [patient] okay . so with the thyroid and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ? [doctor] i do have a lot of people that have thyroid thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency . [patient] okay .
